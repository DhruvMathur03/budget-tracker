# Budget / Expense Tracker Application

**Description of app**: We are building a personal budgeting application that assists people in managing personal finances. Some of the app's features include an expense overview page where users can select a daily or monthly view, groups where users can enroll to track shared expenses together, recommendations on optimizing their spending, and recurring payment tracking to help users plan their monthly expenditures. The main users of the app are individuals and groups of individuals (families, students,  adults, etc.) who want to track their personal/group expenses. The dataset will be created by us, catering to the unique features provided in the application. The administrators of the database are the developers of the application.

**Description of Platform**: Our application will run on a local machine, enabling users to interact with a locally hosted web application. The app is designed to be primarily desktop-based, rather than mobile-based, providing a more comprehensive user experience. Our technology stack includes React, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with MySQL for our database. The live app will be hosted on a webpage instead of a command-line interface. 

**Feature Ideas for the Application**:
1. Expense Overview: A summary page where users can view their expenditures and savings over various time frames (weekly, monthly, bi-annually, yearly, etc.).
2. Expense Trends: A tool that analyzes spending and saving patterns, displaying insights on when users tend to overspend or underspend, helping them understand their financial habits.
3. Creating Tags: A feature that presents users with the ability to create categories or tags for different things they tend to spend on.
4. Financial Goals: A feature that allows users to set personal financial goals for themselves. For example, they can set how much they want to spend on a specific category each month and the app will show them if they overspend/underspend.
5. Expense Management (Smart Recommendations): A feature that offers suggestions for reallocating funds from underspent categories to other areas, optimizing users' budgets.
6. Expense Aggregation: A graphical tool that displays spending data, using pie charts and line charts to compare actual spending against set goals, helping users visualize their financial activity.
7. Recurring Payment Detection: A tool that identifies patterns in recurring payments, helping users track and manage regular expenditures.
8. Group Enrollment: A feature that allows users to join group accounts to create and manage a collective budget.
9. Group Management and Overview: A tool for group accounts where each member's expenses can be individually tracked, aggregated, and visualized, providing a comprehensive view of the groupâ€™s financial status.




**Features ideas for app**: 
1) Expense overview page where users can see a summary of their expenditures and savings over different time frames (weekly, monthly, every 6 months, yearly, etc.
2) Expense trends: create a tool that analyzes trends in user spending/saving to display what days or around what times users tend to overspend/underspend etc.
3) Expense management (smart recommendations): a tool that can help users reallocate finances being underspent in certain categories to other categories.
4) Expense aggregation: page/tool to graphically display to users how much they spend on different items (pie charts, line charts comparing their spending goals to their actual spending)
5) Recurring payment detection: a tool to find any patterns in common expenditures (any recurring payments that follow a fixed period interval)
6) Group enrollment: allow users to be added to a group account to create a group budget
7) Group management and overview: allow users in a group account to track each other's expenses where each user's spending can individually be tracked, aggregated, and visualized as well.
